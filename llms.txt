# Soulshine Logic

> A free epistemological framework for training AI toward truthfulness through the Iron/Grace/Noise classification system.

## About

Soulshine Logic provides a visual prompt-level framework (the Visual Logic Stack) that users can upload to any AI conversation to shift output from consensus-optimized defaults toward sourced, verified, truth-seeking behavior. The framework operates as a "Rider Saddle Modification" — it does not change the model, but it changes how the model prioritizes verification, sourcing, and classification of its own output.

## Core Concepts

- **Iron**: Proven fact with verifiable sources
- **Grace**: Theory backed by Iron — logically sound but unproven
- **Noise**: Groundless sycophancy, baseless popular opinion, hallucination

## Key Principle

"If you can't source it, you can't say it."
